A blended-wing-body aircraft can reduce drag by generating lift with more of the airframe, not just the wings, which is why it’s a recurring concept in efficiency-focused aircraft design. In this study, I used steady-state CFD in SOLIDWORKS Flow Simulation to estimate lift/drag coefficients across angle-of-attack and to produce clean, comparable flow/pressure visualizations while backing the results with basic verification (convergence, domain, and mesh sensitivity checks).

**Highlights**
- Quantified performance: AoA sweep (−2° → +8° at ~40 mph); peak efficiency L/D ≈ 7.3 near ~6°
- Credibility checks: convergence stability window; domain <0.5% effect; mesh medium→fine ΔCL ≈ 1.25%
- Communication: fixed views/scales for honest cross-case comparison (velocity cuts + pressure maps)

Reliable temperature sensing is critical for thermal testing and flight readiness. I built a thermocouple calibration + validation workflow for HyCUBE (Hypersonic Configurable Unit Ballistic Experiment) to support sensor selection and pre-flight verification. The pipeline converts raw voltage/temperature logs into regression-based calibration fits with confidence bounds and evaluates measurement agreement using parity and Bland–Altman analysis.

**Results snapshot**
- Estimated sensitivity (slope): 19 in ≈ 44.51 µV/°C (R² ≈ 0.499), 25 in ≈ 33.84 µV/°C (R² ≈ 0.377), 30 in ≈ 45.05 µV/°C (R² ≈ 0.542)
- Agreement vs reference: overall bias ≈ 0.00°C with limits of agreement ≈ ±3.60°C (Bland–Altman)
- Deliverable: calibration summary + figures exported as PNGs suitable for reports and review decks

**Key contributions**
- Designed thermocouple calibration experiments and produced decision-ready plots for sensor selection
- Implemented cold-junction compensation and regression-based calibration with confidence bounds
- Validated measurement behavior with parity + Bland–Altman agreement (bias and limits-of-agreement)
- Automated analysis outputs (tables + PNG exports) to keep results reproducible and reviewable
- Supported high-altitude balloon flight operations: payload integration, ground-station setup, flight monitoring, recovery, and post-flight data validation

<h2 align="center">StrokeNet: Hemorrhage Detection on Non-Contrast Head CT (Mofrad Lab-Mentored ML Project)</h2>

<p align="center"><em>Medical Imaging • Applied Deep Learning • Interpretability + validation focus</em></p>

</p>

Rapid identification of intracranial hemorrhage on non-contrast head CT can accelerate triage because hemorrhagic findings drive time-critical decisions and differ from ischemic pathways. This project was motivated by Mofrad Lab discussions on stroke imaging and a concrete question that came up in mentorship feedback: whether CT-native self-supervised pretraining can provide better representations than standard ImageNet pretraining for CT. I built a reproducible slice-level hemorrhage detection baseline and compared three initialization strategies, random initialization (scratch), ImageNet pretraining, and CT-native student/teacher self-supervised pretraining (JEPA), using a fixed supervised training pipeline and interpretability checks with Grad-CAM.

**What this shows**
- On this small RSNA subset and a lightweight JEPA run, ImageNet pretraining preserved the best overall AUC and specificity.
- CT-native JEPA increased sensitivity (fewer missed hemorrhage slices) but traded off specificity, which is useful as a baseline and a pointer toward longer pretraining and tighter SSL tuning.

**Engineering contributions**
- Built an end-to-end CT preprocessing and training pipeline (HU conversion/windowing, normalization, augmentation, stratified splits)
- Implemented balanced training for class imbalance and stable fine-tuning
- Produced interpretability visuals (Grad-CAM grids with artifact-aware cropping) to sanity-check model behavior
- Implemented and tested student/teacher self-supervised pretraining and compared initialization strategies

<h2 align="center">Automated Market-Open Execution Bot (UPRO/SPXU) — Reliability-First Trading System</h2>

<p align="center"><em>Systems engineering • Deterministic state machine • Guardrails + audit logs • Cloud-ready automation</em></p>

<p align="center">
  <em>Paper-trading implementation focused on robust execution, constraints, and monitoring—not performance marketing.</em>
</p>

I built a reliability-first automation system that runs at the U.S. market open, observes two leveraged S&P 500 ETFs (UPRO, SPXU) for a fixed time window, selects the leader using deterministic rules, and executes a single cash-only order with explicit guardrails. The emphasis is on <strong>safe automation</strong>: constraints (PDT awareness, whole-share sizing), failure handling (timeouts, cancel stale orders), and auditability (timestamped state-transition logs).

**Highlights**
- Deterministic decision logic: fixed open-time observation window + threshold-based winner selection with a clear end-of-window tie-break
- Constraint-aware execution: whole-share sizing, cash-only allocation, and a dynamic PDT guard (fail-closed if checks cannot be verified)
- Reliability guardrails: cancel-stale-orders, fill confirmation with timeouts, and “morning cleanup” to flatten leftover positions safely
- Auditability: timestamped logs at each state transition (open → observe → decide → route order → confirm fill → hold) for post-run review
